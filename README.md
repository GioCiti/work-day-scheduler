# work-day-scheduler

In this assignment we were tasked in creating a daily planner that allowed effective time management

Guildlines that I needed to follow consist of 
- Having the date and time at the top of the calendar
- Having timeblocks for standard buisness hours (9am- 5pm)
- Having each timeblocks color coded to indicate whether it will be in the past, present or future
- The ability to interact with the calendar and add events 
- The ability for user input to be saved to local storage
- Saved events will persist despite the page being refreshed

For this project I ultized HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also ultized bootstrap for the contrustion of the timeblocks and moment.js for the date and time aspects of the project.
